# covid19
R code to estimate spread of coronavirus.  Inspired by this Twitter thread: https://threader.app/thread/1236095180459003909

Created to get a gut-level sense of what might be heading at us in the US.  Compartment model includes a 'hospitalization' and 'ICU-ization' steps to see what kind of pressure might be put on those public health services.

Definitions of parameters are in the R file along with justification for parameter values.  Based on information in the above thread and this on-line doc:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D4V36_nMqQNh1tusNVqozNjPw6N1457pajuFdPjCSCo/edit#heading=h.ar5dbbzhpidx

Comments that will strengthen the model are welcome.
